# GeoCatch Application

GeoCatch is a cross-platform application for discovering geolocation details of IP addresses and URLs. It uses both online APIs and offline database search to provide detailed information. The app supports **Windows** and **MacOS** platforms.

Please don't mind the Qt QML files, as it is my first time designing a desktop application with this framework and embedded databases.

I had lots of fun exploring the Qt framework over the past couple of days, and I hope you will enjoy using GeoCatch as much as I enjoyed building it!
