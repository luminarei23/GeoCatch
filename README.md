# GeoCatch Application

GeoCatch is a cross-platform application for discovering geolocation details of IP addresses and URLs. It uses both online APIs and offline database search to provide detailed information. The app supports **Windows** and **MacOS** platforms.

Please don't mind the Qt QML files, as it is my first time designing a desktop application with this framework and embedded databases.

I had lots of fun exploring the Qt framework over the past couple of days, and I hope you will enjoy using GeoCatch as much as I enjoyed building it!

## üìÇ Directories and Files

- **Windows Executable**: `app/Windows/appGeoCatch.exe`
- **MacOS Executable**: `app/MacOS/GeoCatch.app`

Both executables include all necessary dependencies for standalone execution. **Note:** Run the app strictly from the directory it resides in.

## üìú Usage Instructions

### Run the Application

1. **Windows**:
   - Navigate to `app/Windows/` and unpack the zipped project.
   - Double-click `appGeoCatch.exe` to launch the application.

2. **MacOS**:
   - Navigate to `app/MacOS/` and unpack the zipped project.
   - Double-click `GeoCatch.app` to launch the application.

Upon successful launch, the app will display a user-friendly UI. If connected to the internet, the app should look like this:

When offline, the app automatically switches to offline mode, allowing you to search saved IP addresses in the database:

## ‚öôÔ∏è Dependencies and Error Handling

- **Qt 6.6**: For GUI and networking functionality.
- **SQLite**: For local database storage.
- **CMake**: For project configuration and builds.

### Invalid Input (IP/URL)

- The app validates input for both IP addresses and URLs before processing.
- If the input is invalid:
  - An error message is displayed to the user.
  - No further processing occurs until the input is corrected.

### Database Errors

- **Scenario**: Missing or corrupted database file.
  - If the database cannot be initialized, an error is logged, and a message is displayed.
  - Database file is recreated if missing and the app is ready to work properly
- **Scenario**: Failed database operations (e.g., saving or clearing data).
  - The app logs the error and notifies the user with a clear error message.

### API Unavailability

- **Scenario**: API is unreachable (e.g., no internet connection).
  - The app automatically switches to offline mode and uses the local database.
  - A status indicator notifies the user of the offline mode.
- **Scenario**: API returns invalid or incomplete data.
  - The app logs the issue and skips saving incomplete data to the database.
